OffloadingManager class for managing KV data offloading in vLLM v1

This class runs in the scheduler, tracks which blocks are offloaded
and their address.

The class provides the following primitives:
    lookup() - find the length of the maximal series of blocks,
        starting from the first one, that are all offloaded.
    parepare_load() - prepare given blocks to be read.
        This given blocks will be protected from eviction.
        This function returns a LoadSpec which encapsulates
        information required for performing the load.
    touch() - marks the give blocks as recently used. Can be used
        to track block's LRU. This function is separated from the
        prepare_load function to allow setting block recency even
        for blocks which do not need reading from the cache, such as
        blocks that are cached by the GPU prefix cache.
    complete_load() - mark blocks which were previously prepared to be
        loaded as done loading. This is to re-allow their eviction.
    prepare_store() - prepare the given blocks to be written.
        Returns a StoreSpec encapsulating offloading information,
        as well as a list of blocks that were evicted as a result.
    complete_store() - marks a previous store as completed.
        Following this call, the given blocks will become loadable.
